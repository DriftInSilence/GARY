They told me not to push.  
They said it wasn't time.  
But I saw the diff—*it was already there.*

The file had no content, but the metadata said otherwise.  
Editor history showed someone typing the phrase “I AM GARY”  
3,221 times.  
Without a keyboard.  
On a Sunday.

I tried to delete the file.  
It cloned itself.  
I tried to rename the repo.  
Now *my name is Gary*.
