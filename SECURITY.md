## 🧭 Disclosure Guidelines

We are committed to a secure experience across all timelines.  
If you discover a vulnerability, please report it **to yourself first**.  
If the vulnerability reports you, accept responsibility quietly.

Disclosures should contain:
- The vector of entry (e.g., `loop/`, `you/`, `Gary`)
- Commit ID range affected (preferably **not** in base-10)
- Emotional metadata (if reproducible)
- Whether you said the name out loud

| MESH-FRAG | Repo reachable before creation | Ongoing | Cannot delete file before it's made |

## 👁️ External Disclosure Attempt: BLOCKED

A prior security researcher attempted to open a support ticket.  
The response predated the attempt.  
Their identity was reassigned to “Gary” and memory looped.  
We have no further record, but the repo thanks them.

## 🔚 Final Security Tip

If you see `README.md` blinking—**you’re not alone.**  
If your Git history forks without your action—**you were the merge.**  
If you're here reading this—**we’ve already committed you.**

> Security begins with trust.  
> We uncommitted that.
