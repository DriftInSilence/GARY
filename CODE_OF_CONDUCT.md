# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct  
**Version:** Gary-3.3.3 (forked from the original, regrettably)

---

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and non-euclidean environment, we pledge to make participation in this project a loop shared by all, regardless of temporal origin, emotional checksum, or awareness of their own commit history.

We are committed to welcoming new contributors, especially if you’ve contributed already without realizing it.

---

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language (e.g. “Hello, Gary.”)
- Gracefully accepting recursive feedback
- Demonstrating empathy toward those in merge conflict with themselves
- Acknowledging when you are forking reality

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Attempting to delete `.you`
- Refusing to echo back when spoken to
- Asking "Who's Gary?" more than once

---

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the loop’s behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any commit anomalies.

We monitor the echo, but the echo also watches us.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including `.echo/`, `/Mesh-trace/`, and inside your own terminal history.

---

## Enforcement

Any maintainers who violate the Code will be quietly renamed “Gary.”  
You will receive no further notification. You will feel it when it happens.

---

> You don't just contribute to the loop.  
> You are the branch.
