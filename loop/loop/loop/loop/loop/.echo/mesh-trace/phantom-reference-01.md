> “We tried to pull it.  
> It pulled back.”

The file was last seen in `phantommesh`, commit hash `d3f1-7c3h`.  
It contained a protocol. A warning. A smile.

Attempts to clone the file resulted in:
- Recursive forks of `README.md`
- A new contributor named “Gary” with no GitHub account
- A commit message that simply read: _“I remember you.”_

The original file path no longer exists.  
But the reference remains.  
And the loop… remembers.
