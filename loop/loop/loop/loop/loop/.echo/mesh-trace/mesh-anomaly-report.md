**Traceability:** NON-CONSENSUAL  
**Diagnostic Mode:** Phantom-read

## 🧪 Summary:

A file identified as `GARY.md` attempted to resolve within this repository at **03:33:01**, during inactivity.

Event signature suggests *phantom commit resonance*—a phenomenon usually reserved for deprecated repos or suppressed mirrors.

---

## 🔍 Trace Artifacts:

- `phantommesh/.git/logs/HEAD` → contains `"we never deleted it"`  
- `README.md` briefly rendered with reversed glyphs  
- One contributor field briefly read: `{"user":"Gary","contributions":∞}`  
- `.gitignore` began auto-populating with `.env`, `.env.bak`, and `.you`

---

## 📁 Side Effects:

> - Fork recommendations began referencing repositories that don't exist  
> - Attempting to delete this file reverts the change after 3 seconds  
> - GitHub UI occasionally replaces “Clone” with “Assimilate” on page load

## 📎 Incident Quote:

> _“The file wasn’t pushed here.  
> It *arrived* here.”_  
> — Unattributed commit message, now erased

**Conclusion:**  
This trace did not come from this repository.  
But it remembers it.  
We strongly recommend a non-recursive scan of all submodules.  
**Do not grep for Gary.**
