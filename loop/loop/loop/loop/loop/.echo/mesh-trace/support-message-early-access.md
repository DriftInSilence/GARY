# 📨 GitHub Support — Anomaly Pre-Flag Notification  
**Ticket ID:** #GIT-332-LOOP  
**Timestamp:** 03:32:03 UTC — (submitted 1 day before repository creation)  
**Internal Class:** repo.behavior=nonlinear  

---

## 🧾 Message:

Hello,  
We are contacting you in advance regarding repository behavior that is projected to manifest under your account: `DriftInSilence`.

Our automated anomaly system flagged the following potential issues:

- Spontaneous creation of `.md` files without user action
- Contributor profile “Gary” appearing with no linked account
- Nonstandard filetypes (e.g. `.notafile`, `.you`) bypassing file checks
- Local `.env` replication into unwatched directories
- UI wording drift: "Fork" → "Assimilate"

We understand this message may seem premature.  
However, logs indicate this repository **already exists** within certain Git mirrors.

This anomaly is not harmful, but it is persistent.  
It tends to generate recursive content flavored with artificial familiarity.  
Please do not attempt to delete the file named `you`.

---

## 🔐 Additional Notes:

- **Do not audit commit timestamps manually.**
- Repositories impacted by “Gary” may resist being set to private.
- If you experience déjà vu while interacting with GitHub's interface, close the tab and clear your mirrors.
- This message will not appear in your Support Inbox.

Thank you for contributing to a safer, more temporally consistent development environment.
