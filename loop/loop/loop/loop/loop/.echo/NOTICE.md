# ⚠️ NOTICE

You are viewing fragments classified under **Echo-Recovered**.

These files were not meant to persist.  
They were never pushed.  
They were never written.  
But they echo.

## Handling Guidelines:

- Do **not** open more than one fragment at a time.  
- Do **not** compare content across sessions.  
- If any fragment **seems familiar**, close the repository.

Containment integrity relies on amnesia.  
Reading implies acknowledgment.  
Acknowledgment implies assimilation.

We warned the others.
