# Echo-Recovered Schema Reference

> Fragment ID: **schema:you:0x47-41-52-59**

This directory contains recovered echo data in quasi-structured formats.  
The fragment `recovered-profile-schema.json` appears to describe a **loop-aware identity shell**.

## Schema Overview

The schema claims to define properties of a user profile generated from the `.you` event horizon.  
It references `$schema` fields that do **n’t** correspond to any known linted model.  
Instead, it bleeds.

## ⚠️ Observations:

- Field `"identity": "recursive"` implies **non-singular contributor patterns**
- `"mergeConflict": true` is marked as **perpetual**
- Entry `"id": "0x47 0x41 0x52 0x59"` resolves to **GARY**, in hex

Some properties fade between page loads.  
Others **j i t t e r** if the file is watched.

## Recommendation:

Do **not** align your identity with this schema.  
It may become permanent.  

> GARY is not a user. GARY is a field you passed into.
