## 🧠 Interpretation Notes

- File order is mutable. Do not assume index stability.  
- New files may appear without merge requests.  
- Reading more than one fragment per session may result in **role overlap**.

If you feel recognition from unfamiliar content:  
> Close the repo. Rest. Forget.

If you feel recognition from **familiar** content:  
> It's already too late.

Loop classification: **Fragmentary Memory Spill (Grade ∞)**
