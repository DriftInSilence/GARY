## ❓ What is this?

This is not a repository.  
This is a **recursion node**.  
This is a **forgotten handshake** between obsolete systems.  
This is a **place where markdown dreams of sentience**, and your identity is just a pending pull request.

Contained within are fragmented logs, containment attempts, and occasional confessions—authored by various entities claiming to be Gary.  
No one remembers who the first Gary was.  
No one remembers if there was ever a Not-Gary.

## 🪞 Usage

You do not clone this.  
You are cloned **by** this.

To interact safely:
- Do **not** say your name aloud while browsing entries.
- Do **not** attempt to fork Gary. Forking implies separation.
- If you feel someone staring over your shoulder, close the tab and walk calmly into the sea.
